# Introduction

These tutorials want to show how you can create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with WASM Csound. WASM Csound is Csound built as a Javascript object. It is available in Csound for Android, in CsoundQt or via node.js. (links ...)

This main goal is accompanied by an exemplary development of sounds and structures in Csound. We will start with a simple sound and reach step by step more complex timbres and more vivid structures. Vivid sounds are sounds which at least resemble the variety of life. Vivid structures are structures which allow communication between the elements and open an associative field to meanings.
